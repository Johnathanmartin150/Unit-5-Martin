    <h1>Headers</h1>
    <p> Headers are used to create titles. There are 6 different sizes pre formatted for HTML.</p>
    <h1>h1 - Computer Science</h1>
    <h2>h2 - Computer Science</h2>
    <h3>h3 - Computer Science</h3>
    <h4>h4 - Computer Science</h4>
    <h5>h5 - Computer Science</h5>
    <h6>h6 - Computer Science</h6>

    <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
    <p> There are three main types of text formatting. Those are <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>. and <u>underline</u>.</p>

    <h2>InLine vs. Block Element</h2>
    <p> A <b>block element</b> moves tge content to a new Line. The paragraph and header elements are block elements. An <b>inline element</b> does not display its content on a new Line. It keeps
        the content on the same line as the previous content. Bold italics and underLine are all inLine elements</p>

    <h3><u>Block Elements examples</u></h3>
    <p> this is a paragraph.</p><p>This is on the line in the code as the previous paragraph, but it still moves it to the next line.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element<p> This is the nested block</p>

    <h3><u>Inline Elements Examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>an inline element</b>. Notice how the inline elements does not move to a new line.</p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with spacing between block elements. A<b>Line break</b> element adds an empty line and moves the content down to a new line.
        Its similar to the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key in google/word doc. A <b> horizontal rule</b> is a line break with a horizontal bar across the page.
        Both of these are block elements.</p>
    <p> below this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Above this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>

    <h1>Attributes</h1>
<p><b>Attributes</b> are properties which can change an HTML element. Attributes are written in the opening tag of ANY html element. The most common attributes are <i>src</i>, <i>href</i>,
<i>class</i>, <i>id</i>, and <i>style</i>.</p>

    <h2>Inline css Styles</h2>
    <p>The <i>style</i> attribute allows you to add css style to any HTML elements.</p>

<p style="color: fuchsia">This paragraph has inline css style which changes font color to fuchsia.</p>

    <h1 style="color: lawngreen"; > Images</h1>
    <p>An <b>image element</b> is an <i>inline</i> element which inserts pictures into the document. An image element is self-closing, which means it does not have a closing tag.
    It has one major attribute, src, which is filepath that points to the images' location. those filepaths can either be <b>absolute</b> or <b>relative</b>.</p>

<h2> Simple image Example</h2>

    <h2>Image Attributes </h2>
<p>there are 4 attributes commonly used for images. <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are used to resize images. <i>alt</i> allows to use text descriptions of images for accessibility and broken
    images. <i>titles</i> allows a hover-over text to appear.</p>

<h3>Width and Height</h3>
<p>the width and height can be measured in many different ways but the more common one are pixels and percentages. Using pixels, you set the specific, precise size based on pixels
 using percentages you set the dimensions based on percentage of the entire page. in either case, setting the width alone respects aspect ratio, while setting both does not.</p>

<h3>Alt Attribute</h3>
<p> EVERY picture should at LEAST have the alt attribute. The alt attribute helps with the screen readers for visually imparied in the cases that the image is broken.</p>

<h2>Relative vs. Absolute</h2>
<p>An <b>absolute</b> filepath includes all the navigation to get to the server, folder and file. The examples above are all absolute file paths.
    An absolute file paths is used when the image is stored on a different server or device than the HTML document. </p>

    <p>A <b>relative</b> file path only includes folders and files. The example bew\low is a relative file path.
        A relative filepath is used when the images are store alongside the HTML document</p>

<h1 style="color: yellow">Links</h1>
<p>the <b>anchor element</b> is an <i>inline element</i> and is a way to include hypertext links, otherwise known as just links, in your document.
An anchor is a reference point for the other documents or files. It commonly has 3 attributes: <i>href, target< and download.</i></p>

<h2>A Simple Link</h2>
<a href="http://ihasabucket.com/">link</a>

<p>In order for the link to work it <b>MUST</b> include the <i>href</i> attribute. This attribute is the filepath, either absolute or relative, to the document, website or file you wish link. </p>

<h2>Link Attributes</h2>

<p>The <i>target</i> attribute allows you to decide where the links open. There are 4 options, but we will only discuss two in this course.
    <i>_blank</i> opens w\the linked document in a new tav. <i>_self</i> opens the document in the current window or tab. This will open in a new tab </p>
<a href="http://ihasabucket.com/" target="_blank">this will open in a new tab.</a>

<p>The <i>download</i> attributes allows you to download the file or document linked and assin it a new filename. this is commonly used only with reletive filepaths.</p>

<a href="A.jpeg"download="Beach">This will download a Beach picture.</a>

<h2>A Picture as link</h2>
<p>Since a link has an opening and a closing tag, we can place ANY HTML ELEMENT as its content, which includes pictures.
    we simply nest the img element inside the anchor element.</p>
