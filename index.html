    <h1>Headers</h1>
    <p> Headers are used to create titles. There are 6 different sizes pre formatted for HTML.</p>
    <h1>h1 - Computer Science</h1>
    <h2>h2 - Computer Science</h2>
    <h3>h3 - Computer Science</h3>
    <h4>h4 - Computer Science</h4>
    <h5>h5 - Computer Science</h5>
    <h6>h6 - Computer Science</h6>

    <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
    <p> There are three main types of text formatting. Those are <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>. and <u>underline</u>.</p>

    <h2>InLine vs. Block Element</h2>
    <p> A <b>block element</b> moves tge content to a new Line. The paragraph and header elements are block elements. An <b>inline element</b> does not display its content on a new Line. It keeps
        the content on the same line as the previous content. Bold italics and underLine are all inLine elements</p>

    <h3><u>Block Elements examples</u></h3>
    <p> this is a paragraph.</p><p>This is on the line in the code as the previous paragraph, but it still moves it to the next line.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element<p> This is the nested block</p></p>

    <h3><u>Inline Elements Examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>an inline element</b>. Notice how the inline elements does not move to a new line.</p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with spacing between block elements. A<b>Line break</b> element adds an empty line and moves the content down to a new line.
        Its similar to the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key in google/word doc. A <b> horizontal rule</b> is a line break with a horizontal bar across the page.
        Both of these are block elements.</p>
    <p> below this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Above this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>
